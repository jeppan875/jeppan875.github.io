My name is Jesper and I live in north-west Stockholm in a suburb called Sp√•nga. I live there 
with my fiancee Carolina and my daughter Eva. 

I'm currently working for a software testing agency. My goal is to shift to software development once 
my studies at Linnaus University is finished. At weekends I drive taxi to get some extra income.

In my freetime I spend my time at home with my family. My daughter is just 3 months so she needs her parents 
to look after her all the time. 

Right now I look forward going on vacation to Brazil where my fiancee originally comes from. 
There I will sit at the beach and drink a caipirinha.
